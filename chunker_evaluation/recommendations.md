* Further investigate the impact of different chunk sizes and overlap values on the performance of the sliding window chunker. Try a wider range of chunk sizes and overlap values to find the optimal configuration for your specific needs. Consider using a more fine-grained approach, such as testing chunk sizes in increments of 100 or 200.

* Analyze the specific questions where the chunkers perform differently to gain deeper insights into their strengths and weaknesses. Identify patterns in the types of questions that are better handled by certain chunking strategies. This analysis can provide valuable insights into the limitations of each approach and guide further optimization efforts.

* Explore other chunking strategies. The real goal of text splitters is to divide the text into semantically coherent chunks. They often fall short. Therefore any improvement in this area should improve retrieval performance. The chunking_evaluation library offers several other chunking strategies beyond the ones tested in this evaluation. These include:

    * Fixed-size sliding window with overlap: Splits text into fixed-size chunks with a specified overlap.
    * Variable-size sliding window: Dynamically adjusts the chunk size based on sentence boundaries or other criteria.
    * LLM-based splitting: Leverages a large language model (LLM) to split text into semantically meaningful chunks. This approach can potentially capture more nuanced context and improve retrieval accuracy.
    * Cluster-based semantic chunking: Groups sentences into clusters based on their semantic similarity and then forms chunks from these clusters. This approach can help capture related information within a single chunk.

* Investigate the impact of different embedding models on retrieval performance. The choice of embedding model can significantly influence the quality of the retrieved chunks. Experiment with different models, such as those specializing in semantic similarity or domain-specific knowledge, to potentially improve retrieval accuracy.

* Fine-tuning the LLM used for question answering on domain-specific data.
* Fine-tuning the Embedding model on domain-specific data.
